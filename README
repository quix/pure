Pure functional programming in Ruby with automatic parallelism and
lazy evaluation.

== Synopsis

  require 'pure'
  
  module Geometry
    include Pure
  
    def area(width, height)
      width*height
    end
  
    def width(border)
      7 + border
    end
  
    def height(border)
      5 + border
    end
  
    def border
      2
    end
  end
  
  # compute the area using 3 parallel threads
  puts Geometry.compute :area, :threads => 3
  # => 63

  # We've done this computation.
  puts((7 + 2)*(5 + 2))
  # => 63
